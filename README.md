## Problem description

This is from the TypeScript template installed on Feb-7-2023. I added one file - `experiment.tsx`. Notice the compile error. For some reason I can call my component using function syntax and TypeScript is happy and provides proper auto-complete. But I can't use this component using JSX syntax. Shouldn't I get the same result either way?

I noticed the Solid playground does **not** like this code however I use it. I have no idea why.
